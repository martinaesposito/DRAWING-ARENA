# Drawing Arena
A drawing platform designed for kids to make them interact with digital devices in unusual ways. </br>
By rotating the phone the player draws a line that changes tint each time it hits one of the colored dots spread all over the arena. The platform was developed both for desktop and mobile using P5js, a javascript and processing library designed to make generative art and crea- tive coding sketches.
